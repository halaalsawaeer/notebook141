            Caffeine is a stimulant - it raises your heart rate and blood pressure to boost your energy levels and mood
            The caffeine hit is what you need to wake up your brain and boost your energy - not to mention good coffee is delicious.
            Caffeine is a stimulant - it raises your heart rate and blood pressure to boost your energy levels and mood.

The effects of coffee vary from person to person, as with any drug the way your body reacts depends on how quickly it metabolises the caffeine.

Typically, it takes anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes for caffeine levels to peak in your blood.
At that time your heart rate and blood pressure will rise, and that's what gives you the awake feeling you craved when you woke up.

But after that it's quickly metabolised by your liver, so the effects won't last all day.

Caffeine has a half life of about five hours.

The average cup of coffee has about 40mg of caffeine, so after five hours only 20mg will be left in your system.
